# Working on Lutecepowers

This repository is a plugin for coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode) that helps develop and migrate Lutece 8 plugins. Its content is prose the agents read, so precision matters more than volume.

## Ground truth

- What Lutece 8 really does lives in `~/.lutece-references/` (cloned by `hooks/sync-references`). A statement in a skill, rule or pattern is right when the reference code does it, wrong otherwise. Verify by grep before writing.
- Versions are never hardcoded: the parent POM is the latest released `lutece-global-pom` 8.x read from the release repository (`rules/dependency-convergence.md`).
- One supported Lutece 8 level, set once in `tools/v8-floor.conf` and enforced by `check-v8-floor.sh`. Everything written here describes that level; nothing describes, branches on or works around an older v8.
- Only coding agents verified with a live session are declared as supported (README). No manifest, install command or claim for a tool that was not exercised.

## Single source per topic

- `rules/*.md` are canonical for their path scope (DAO, service, web, templates, SQL, POM, tests). Skills and patterns link to them instead of repeating.
- `tools/` holds every script the skills, agents and hooks share; `tools/lutece-check.sh` is the entry point. A check lives in its script, its explanation in `tools/checks.md` (read by `lutece-check.sh --explain`); skills never list what a script reports.
- `skills/using-lutecepowers/SKILL.md` is injected at every session start: shared paragraphs (plugin root, references, team rules) live there once.
- Generated files, never edited by hand: `rules-cursor/*.mdc` (`scripts/build-cursor-rules.sh`) and the skills and rules tables of `README.md` and `skills/using-lutecepowers/SKILL.md` (`scripts/build-tables.sh`).

## Writing rules

- Skills follow the Agent Skills format: frontmatter `name` (= directory), `description` starting with "Use when", optional `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`. No Claude-only frontmatter or tool names; say "ask the user", "dispatch a subagent".
- English, minimal, present tense. No history prose. Scripts: one doc comment above each function, no comments inside.
- Skills never commit; a project has one writer at a time.
